# KDJ Cream Website

Welcome to the KDJ Cream premium website project.

## Overview
This is a multi-page e-commerce style website designed for selling "KDJ Cream". It features a luxurious design, responsive layout, and interactive elements.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5**: Structural markup.
- **Tailwind CSS (CDN)**: Rapid styling and responsive design. No Node.js installation required.
- **JavaScript**: Simple interactions (Mobile menu, sticky navbar).
- **FontAwesome**: Icons.
- **Google Fonts**: Playfair Display (Headings) and Montserrat (Body).

## How to Run
Since this project uses the Tailwind CSS CDN, there is no build process required.

1.  Simply double-click on `index.html` to open it in your default web browser.
2.  Navigate through the links (Shop, About, Contact) to view other pages.

## Customization
- **Images**: The site currently uses high-quality placeholder images from Unsplash. You can replace these with your actual product photos by updating the `src` attributes in the HTML files.
- **Colors**: The color palette (Gold, Cream, Dark) is defined in the `<script>` tag within the `<head>` of each HTML file. You can modify these hex codes to match your brand identity.
- **Content**: Edit the text within the HTML files to reflect your specific product details and brand story.
